There are $K$ total sites

There are $N$ subjects per site

There are $C$ components per subject

$W^i_l$ denotes the unmixing matrix for subject $l$ at site $i$

$X^i_l$ denotes the $l^{th}$ subject at site $i$

$Y^i_l$ denotes the approximation to subject $l$ at site $i$

$\hat{Y}^i$ denotes the site source for site $i$. Explained further in algorithm section

$W^{Gi}$ denotes the master node unmixing matrix for the $i^{th}$ site

$S^i_l$ denotes the master node approximation to the true source of site $i$



At each site, there is a sub IVA (or ICA / group ICA) problem of finding statistically independent sources for each subject

        W^i_1   & 0         & \dots     & 0         \\

At the master node, there is a main IVA (or ICA / group ICA) problem of finding statistically independent sources for the site sources $\hat{Y}$
        
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}
        W^{G1}  & 0         & \dots     & 0         \\

        \vdots  & \vdots    & \ddots    & \vdots    \\
        0       & 0         & \dots     & W^{GN}
    \end{pmatrix}

        \hat{Y}^1   \\
        \hat{Y}^2   \\

        \vdots  \\
        S^N
